#### Description:

Namaste , My self ANMOL YADAV FROM  City is known as "the City of LIGHTS" in INDIA Called Varanasi. 

Now I am giving you a small theory about my project 


I've created a basic currency converter using web technologies: HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the functionality. This project takes user input, including the amount to convert and the source and target currencies, and performs the conversion based on pre-defined exchange rates.


This is a small project to create a currency converter using standard web development tools. We use HTML to structure the elements on the page, such as the input fields, dropdowns, and button. Then we add styling using CSS to make it visually appealing. Lastly, we use JavaScript to handle the core logic: taking input, using placeholder exchange rates to do the conversion, and display the result on the page. This is a great starting point to see a web application come together piece by piece.
